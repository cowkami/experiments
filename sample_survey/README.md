# Sample Survey

## Introduction
When we want to estimate the prevalence of an infectious disease in a large population, we often use sample survey methods.
In this section, I introduce two commonly used sample survey methods: the Frequentist's approach and the Bayesian approach.
I compare and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

## Problem

I formalize the sample survey as a statistics problem.
So I introduce some symbols as following.

|symbol|meaning|
|---|---|
|$D$|a population|
|$N$|the population size of $D$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$|
|$\hat{\theta}$|the true parameter of $D$ distribution|
|$X$|observed data sampled from the population, $X \subset D$|
|$x$|data point of $D$, $x \in D$|

## Baysian approach
