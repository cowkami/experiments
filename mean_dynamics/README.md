# Question
Is it natural for the average price to increase in a marketplace?

## Hypothesis
It is natural.
This is because the average price tends to converge to the mean of a potential price distribution, which is often a long-tail distribution.
The fewer samples we have, the more likely we are to get a smaller average.
Conversely, the more samples we have, the more likely we are to get a larger average.

## Proof 
First I examined the mean sampled from gaussian converges to the mean with sample size.
Second I simulated the mean sampled from long-tail distrubution is increase along with sample size rises.
